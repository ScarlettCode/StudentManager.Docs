## **Enrolling a Student**
*There is just some setting up on the system you need to complete first before you can enrol your student.*

**Some tips!**

Ensure you have added your Students, Modules, Qualifications and set up your Curriculum. 
Secondly you will need to set up the level groupings (years and semesters) and Module groupings (your classes). Then
you will be ready to use the Enrolment Wizard.
